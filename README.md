Franklin Final Project

App Idea: IOS App that allows users to maintain a catalogue of the ingredients in their fridge. Using that database of ingredients, we are also able to recommend recipes. The user will be able to add ingredients to their fridge by scanning the barcode or adding it manually. 

Feature 1: User profile
Username and password log in (should be hashed)
Maintain basic user info such as preference for maximum calories per meal 

Feature 2: Virtual Fridge
Maintain the list of ingredients that the user has and how much of it 
Add ingredients through barcode scanning or manual input
Take out ingredients manually 

Feature 3: Recipe Recommendation 
Use an external API to get a list of recipes that the user could make with the ingredients in their virtual fridge 
Sort based on User Profileâ€™s preferences
